## Leetcode 350 - Intersection of Two Arrays II

### Question

Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return their intersection. Each element must appear in the result as many times as it appears in **both** arrays. The result may be returned in any order.

### Intuition

Sort both arrays to bring equal elements together. Then use **two pointers** to find matches without repeatedly searching the arrays.

### Approach

- Sort `nums1` and `nums2`.
- Use `i` and `j` to track the current positions in the two arrays.
- Allocate an output array of length `Math.min(nums1.length, nums2.length)` and use `size` as the write index.
- If both values match, store the value and advance both pointers.
- Otherwise, advance the pointer whose value is smaller.
- Return `Arrays.copyOf(result, size)` to remove unused output slots.

### Time Complexity

$$
O(n\log n + m\log m)
$$

Sorting the two arrays takes $O(n\log n + m\log m)$ time, and the two-pointer scan takes $O(n+m)$ time.

### Space Complexity

$$
O(\min(n,m))\text{ for the result array, excluding sorting overhead}
$$

The result buffer stores at most $\min(n,m)$ elements. Sorting may use additional implementation-dependent space.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int[] intersect(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        Arrays.sort(nums1);
        Arrays.sort(nums2);

        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        int size = 0;
        int[] result = new int[Math.min(nums1.length, nums2.length)];

        while (i < nums1.length && j < nums2.length) {
            if (nums1[i] == nums2[j]) {
                result[size] = nums1[i];
                size++;
                i++;
                j++;
            } else if (nums1[i] < nums2[j]) {
                i++;
            } else {
                j++;
            }
        }

        return Arrays.copyOf(result, size);
    }
}
```

## Leetcode 169 - Majority Element

### Question

Given an integer array `nums`, return the **majority element**: the value that appears **more than** $\lfloor n/2\rfloor$ times. The problem guarantees that a majority element exists.

### Method 1 - Sorting + Counting

#### Intuition

My first solution was to sort the array so that equal elements appear consecutively. I then counted adjacent matches and tracked which group was the longest.

#### Approach

- Sort `nums` with `Arrays.sort(nums)`.
- Set `j = 0` for the current group's **number of adjacent equal pairs**, `max = 0` for the largest count found, and `result = nums[0]`.
- Starting at index `1`, compare `nums[i - 1]` with `nums[i]`.
- If they match, increase `j`. Otherwise, update the best group if `j > max`, and reset `j`.
- **After the loop**, compare the final group with `max` because the last group may never enter the `else` branch.

Note that a group of $k$ equal elements produces `j = k - 1`; this works for comparing group lengths because every group is measured the same way.

#### Time Complexity

$$
O(n\log n)
$$

Sorting dominates the linear scan.

#### Space Complexity

The counting logic itself uses $\Theta(1)$ extra space; `Arrays.sort(nums)` may use additional implementation-dependent space.

#### Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int majorityElement(int[] nums) {
        int j = 0;
        int max = 0;
        int result = nums[0];

        Arrays.sort(nums);
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i - 1] == nums[i]) {
                j++;
            } else {
                if (max < j) {
                    max = j;
                    result = nums[i - 1];
                }
                j = 0;
            }
        }

        if (max < j) {
            max = j;
            result = nums[nums.length - 1];
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

### Method 2 - Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm

#### Intuition

A majority element occurs more often than all **other** elements combined. We can cancel one occurrence of a candidate with one different value. Whenever the remaining vote count becomes zero, we start with a new candidate. Because the majority element is guaranteed to exist, it must survive these cancellations.

#### Approach

- Set `count = 0` and `candi = 0`.
- Walk through `nums` once.
- When `count == 0`, select the current number as the new candidate.
- If the number equals the candidate, increment `count`; otherwise, decrement it.
- Return the final candidate. No separate validation pass is necessary **because the problem guarantees a majority element**.

#### Time Complexity

$$
\Theta(n)
$$

We examine every element exactly once.

#### Space Complexity

$$
\Theta(1)
$$

We only keep two integer variables.

#### Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int majorityElement(int[] nums) {
        int count = 0;
        int candi = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (count == 0) {
                candi = nums[i];
            }

            if (nums[i] == candi) {
                count++;
            } else {
                count--;
            }
        }

        return candi;
    }
}
```

### Comparison

| Method | Time Complexity | Extra Space |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sorting + Counting | $O(n\log n)$ | $\Theta(1)$ for counting, plus sorting overhead |
| Boyer-Moore Voting | $\Theta(n)$ | $\Theta(1)$ |

**Additional observation:** After sorting, the guaranteed majority element must occupy index `nums.length / 2`, so a shorter sorting-based solution can return that element directly.
